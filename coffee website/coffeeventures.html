<p>Little backstory-
My name is Chuck! Welcome to this very homemade website! Professional huh? 
Well, this started as not really a challenge, but more of a brainstorm <br/>that became a personal challenge. My fiancée doesn’t like me really drinking coffee, but for this guy-coffee is LIFE. And Thought; why not combine coffee, running and traveling all into one area?
