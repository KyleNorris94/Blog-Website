<article id="intro">My name is Chuck! Welcome to this very homemade website! Professional huh? <br/>
(Totes)<br/>
Well, this started as not really a challenge, but more of a brainstorm that became a personal because of a challenge. <br/>My fiancée doesn’t like me really drinking coffee, but for this guy-coffee is LIFE. And Thought; why not combine coffee, running and traveling all into one area? 
<br/>To begin, the focus of this website is to travel around various parts of the world, try the various coffees of the world, and find awesome places to run. Pretty simple stuff really! However, was thinking about what would <br/>make this challenge even more fun was to have people recommend what coffee shops and running trails they enjoy! Hear from locals themselves about where to go, what coffees to try and what routes to run.
